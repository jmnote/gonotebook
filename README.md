# Notebook Format (nbformat) for Go 
This package provides Notebook Format structs for Go developers.
It currently supports nbformat versions from [v4.0](https://github.com/jupyter/nbformat/blob/v5.10.4/nbformat/v4/nbformat.v4.0.schema.json) to [v4.5](https://github.com/jupyter/nbformat/blob/v5.10.4/nbformat/v4/nbformat.v4.5.schema.json).

## Goal
To enable lossless bidirectional conversion between `nbformat` and Go struct `Notebook`.

## Testing
Tested using ipynb files generated by [nbconvert](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert), as well as all valid ipynb files from the [nbconvert](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert) and [nbformat](https://github.com/jupyter/nbformat) repositories (excluding v2 and v3 files). The ipynb files are located in the `tests` directory.
